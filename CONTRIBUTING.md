# Contributing to Tcalls

Thank you for being interested in contributing to Tcalls!

## General guidelines

Here are some things to keep in mind for all types of contributions:

- Follow the ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) workflow.
- Fill out the checked-in pull request template when opening pull requests. Note related issues and tag relevant maintainers.
- Ensure your PR passes formatting, linting, and testing checks before requesting a review.
- Backwards compatibility is key. Your changes must not be breaking, except in case of critical bug and security fixes.
- Look for duplicate PRs or issues that have already been opened before opening a new one.
- Keep scope as isolated as possible. As a general rule, your changes should not affect more than one package at a time.

### Bugfixes

For bug fixes, please open up an issue before proposing a fix to ensure the proposal properly addresses the underlying problem. In general, bug fixes should all have an accompanying unit test that fails before the fix.

### New features

For new features, please start a new [discussion](https://github.com/onemquan/tcalls/discussions), where the maintainers will help with scoping out the necessary changes.
